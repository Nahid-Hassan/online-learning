I'm assuming you already know the term WeChat mini program.
But let's take a look at its official definition given by WeChat.
A mini Program is a program which can be used without being downloaded or installed.
It achieves the goal of making apps available instantly.
Users can open many programs just by scanning QR codes or doing a search on WeChat.
Users don't have to worry about having too many apps.
Meaning programs are available wherever and whenever you need,
without insulation and uninstallation.
Compared to conventional mobile apps,
mini programs are quick to start and don't need much education.
They can be easily shared with friends on WeChat groups.
Mini programs have a great user experience for both users and developers.
Initially released in 2017,
mini programs and our passive WeChat uses daily lives.
Since the mini game jump was released,
WeChat mini programs have become even more popular.
There are 170 million daily active users of mini programs.
More than 580,000 mini programs have been published on WeChat.
Mini programs are involved in every aspect of our lives, from retail,
food delivery, bike sharing,
