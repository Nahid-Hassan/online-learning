### Pivoting too Early

So a few times in my career I've ended up in situations where we've had to
pivot and it's mostly based on the assumptions that we had or the theory
that we were trying to test just didn't work out for whatever reason.
Or a partner had a different opinion. So, in one of my tech startups we did
a technical demo that failed and so we pivoted into a new
technical direction. Based on the technology we had which also didn't work out
the way we had anticipated. So we pivoted again and ended up acquiring a small company in
business and trying to work that into our core business which turned out not to be lucrative so
that changed the conditions upon which we were operating our business. So we pivoted again into
a completely different category of technology business while still trying to leverage that initial
seed of technology that we had. The perception forme was we were running amok,
we were just like wildly thrashing around and it wasn't acceptable.
So, at that point I stepped back personally and just sort of took stock
of what we had and what I believed in at that point, went back to my core values.
And went back to our first idea and decided on a re-implementation of that.
And that actually gave the company the engineering direction
it needed to launch a product. It only took six years.

### Business Guidelines

Okay, so in the context of of guidelines and planning, and maybe overp lanning in a business,
there's a real danger for startups. I think, or at least it's been my
experience that people who are not maybe directly involved in the process
of creating the thing that's at the core of the business. Maybe in like a software company,
it's the engineers. Or a marketing company, it's the ads, or what have you.
The people who are making the decisions, if they're too disconnected from
the actual acts of the company, there isa real problem where they could create
plans that are just disconnected from the actual realities of the business.
I mean, I can't provide off the top of my head any direct examples because I'm
just forgetting all of them right now. But I've seen companies fail
all the time for misdirection. Bad planning, not understanding what business you're actually in.
So, especially in startups where you are effectively building a business
that has no roadmap, you cannot build a roadmap in advance of that.
You can only reflect on the things that others have done before.
And usually you're going to get that wrong. The whole purpose of a startup is to carve a new
path in an area where there are no paths. And trying to calculate in advance too far where you're trying to go or what you're trying to do or how you're going to get there can actually lead you
way off base from where you're trying to go.

### Opportunity Cost

**Definition**: The loss of potential gain from other alternatives when one alternative is chosen

#### Here is few Question you can ask yourself to help evaluate your opportunity cost.

- Is there something I could be doing right now that would be a better use of my time.
- Can I use my resources better?
- What is the best use of my skills or my team skills.

Moving forward, try to think, what else could I be doing right now? Is there way my time, money,
or resources could be better spent?

### Don't be perfectionist

We were so obsessed with the little things that didn't matter
like the of a specific button or the specific experience when the user
is clicking back but is not logged in. All kinds of side things that won't move
the needle and doesn't really matter. And it's very important to make sure
that the experience is perfect and you're nailing it on the first time but
you need to make sure that the product is right and not the buttons.
Need to make sure the general flow and the problem that is being solved
with your product is right, and not the specific background color or
the perfect logo or the responsiveness of the website because that's optimisation.
You do that in the AB testing part. You do that after you nail your MVP but
we did that before we met them MVP and we waited a lot of time on that and I wish we hadn't.
It will not happen again.

### Introducing Guidelines

Now that you have a better idea of what `goals` you have for your business, `how are you going to accomplish them`?

#### Guidelines

Do do this, you'll need to create a few guidelines of what actions you plan to take.

Let's look into what these `guidelines` are, then make a few for your business.

We'll also hear from `Matt` about the difference between building an `MVP vs building a perfect product`. Use this to help define which type of product you'd like to build, and what actions you need to get the job done.

#### You can't plan everything

Remember, these will probably change, and you shouldn't expect to be able to plan everything out. What this WILL do is give you a better sense of where you are, and what you can get done in the near future.

###### Note: MVP = Minimum Viable Product (নুন্যতম টেকসই পণ্য)

### Perfection vs MPV

As an entrepreneur when you're looking at your product and
you're trying to determine whether an MVP is good enough, and
whether you have to reach your product perfection before you can go out to
customers, some of this depends on what customers you initially go after.
And as an entrepreneur, part of being an entrepreneur is
maybe selecting the right customers out of the gate.
Can you find customers who are willing to take something that's not
quite finished and provide valuable feedback? Are they willing to take something and
incorporate it into their business? Those are the first
customers that you want. Because some customers on
the other hand might tell you, we don't want to try this or use it in
our business until it's completely done and it's out in the marketplace.
And if those are your initial set of customers, then the bar is too high
before you can get feedback. And so part of figuring out what that
MVP is, is actually figuring out who your first customers are and selecting
the right set of first customers.

### Creating Guidelines

#### Define

- Meet the goals you set.
- How will you accomplish these goals?
- What will you do?

#### Example

**_90 users in 3 months_**

- You could attend some meetup events nearby and try to raise awareness about your product.
- Maybe you prefer social media and would like to market through those types of channels instead.
- Really, whatever works for you that you think would help you meet the goals you set is what you should try.

So, with all this in mind, go through each of the goals you set for yourself. And try to come up with a technique that you can use to make progress towards achieving that goal.

### General Entrepreneurs Advice

`Just be passionate`. Understand what it is you want and why you doing this thing. Because if you don't, you are chasing something or following someones else advice, you are living what they want, not what you want. The best way to succeed that I found is to follow that thing that is important to you and knowing what's important to you is actually a big chance actually a big challenge,
a lot of people don't know. There's a few other things I can add to this.
One is, my dream was always to come to California and work for one of the largest, most influential companies in the area. I've had this dream since I read Microserf's when I was 12 and it took 20 odd years before that actually happened but it did happen. But through the process of just always focusing on that's my goal and everything that I'm going to do is somehow going to get me there.
All the businesses that I started, all the business partners and relationships I built and communities that I was involved in through all the businesses that I ran, I was always
looking to come specifically here. On the flip side of that, something I would advise all
entrepreneurs to be aware of especially in the startup scene, is that startups are seen as a product now. They are a commodity in and out of themselves. There is an entire industry that is built up around selling things to startups and selling the concept of startups.
Don't believe the hype. Do not waste your time going to stupid conferences for
silly awards that mean nothing to your business. Always focus on your core values and what your business means to you and why it's valuable.
