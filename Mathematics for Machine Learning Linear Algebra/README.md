# Mathematics for Machine Learning

For a lot of higher level courses in Machine Learning and Data Science, you find you need to freshen up on the basics in mathematics - stuff you may have studied before in school or university, but which was taught in another context, or not very intuitively, such that you struggle to relate it to how it’s used in Computer Science. This specialization aims to bridge that gap, getting you up to speed in the underlying mathematics, building an intuitive understanding, and relating it to Machine Learning and Data Science.

## Linear Algebra

In the first course on Linear Algebra we look at what linear algebra is and how it relates to data. Then we look through what vectors and matrices are and how to work with them.

### Introduction: Solving data science challenges with mathematics

Hi there, I'm David Dye, and welcome to the Mathematics for Machine Learning specialization. Before we get stuck in, let's set the scene.

**Machine learning is a set of powerful mathematical tools that enable us, to represent, interpret, and control the complex world around us.**

However, even just the word mathematics makes some people feel uneasy and unwelcome to explore the topic. The purpose of this specialization is to take you on a tour through the basic maths underlying these methods, focusing in particular on building your intuition rather than worrying too much about the details. Thanks to the amazing machine learning community, it's actually possible to apply many powerful machine learning methods without understanding very much about the underpinning mathematics, by using open source libraries. This is great, but problems can arise and without some sense of the language and meaning of the relevant maths, you can struggle to work out what's gone wrong or how to fix it. The ideal outcome of this specialization is that it will give you the confidence and motivation to immediately dive into one of the hundreds of boolean applied machine learning courses already available online, and not be intimidated by the matrix notation or the calculus. We want to open up machine learning to as many people as possible, and not just leave all the fun to computer scientists. This first course offers the `introduction to linear algebra which is essentially a set of notational conventions and handy operations, that allow you to manipulate large systems of equations conveniently`. Over the next five modules, we'll be focusing on building your intuition about `vectors` and `translations` through the use of quizzes and interactive widgets as well as occasionally asking you to fill in the gaps in some `Python coding` examples. In the final module, Dr. Sam Cooper will bring it all together by showing you how linear algebra is at the heart of `Google's famous page rank algorithm`, which is used for deciding the order of web pages in search results. Hopefully, if you find this course useful, you'll stick around for a follow-on course by Sam and I who will introduce you to `multivariate calculus`. Then, in our other course Dr. Mark Dyes and I will introduce `principal component analysis`.

### How to be successful in this course

**Tips for studying online**:

Having all the freedom to study online is nice, but this might make it difficult to focus and start studying. When learning online, you should become a self-directed learner!

Here are some great tips for you, collected from this [blog][1], on how to be successful in your online class:

1. Read the syllabus: all the important information can be found here!
1. Plan weekly study times
1. Log on to the class at least 3 times a week
1. Ask questions
1. Make connections with your fellow learners

**Requirements**:

This course explains some of the fundamentals of Linear Algebra and translates these to the basics of Machine Learning. As a learner, you will practice with these basics and in order to do so you’ll find exercises that require different types of interactivity. Alongside video lectures and quizzes, you’ll also get to work with code blocks and Jupyter Notebooks. These are integrated within the course: you don’t need any specific hardware or software packages to access these.
