### Elementary Statistics

**Course Overview**:

- Module 1 (Lesson 1-2): Research Methods and Visualizing Data
- Module 2 (Lesson 3-4): Describing Data
- Module 3 (Lesson 5-7): Normal Distribution
- Module 4 (Lesson 8-9): Estimation and Hypothesis Testing
- Module 5 (Lesson 10-13): t-tests and ANOVA
- Module 6 (Lesson 14-16): Relationship Between two Variables.

**Quiz - MnMs**:

A lots of statistics is just about using your intuition. In this course, you build on the intuition that you already have.

**Google Spreadsheet**:

When we want to do any kind of calculation we use an equal sign

    =sum(start_cell : end_cell)

**Snowfall Data**:

Now for calculating total snowfall in Season 1:

    =sum(A2:A24)

**Calculate sum/total snowfalls for each season**:

> write this `sum(A2:A24)` in any blank cell.

    =sum(A2:A24) # 122
    =sum(b2:b27) # 173
    =sum(c2:c26) # 129

#### The Science of Decisions

> We live in a time of unprecedented access to information...data. Whether researching the best school, job, or relationship, the Internet has thrown open the doors to vast pools of data. Statistics are simply objective and systematic methods for describing and interpreting information so that you may make the most informed decisions about life.

### Intro To Statistical Research Methods

**Trust survey results**:

What information would help you trust these survey results?

- [X] How many people I surveyed?
- [X] Who I surveyed?
- [X] How the survey is conducted?
